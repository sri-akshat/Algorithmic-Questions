//    Googly sum
//    Max. Score 100
//    In this problem of Googly sum nikki gives you a sequence A consisting of N integers. nikki will call the ith sequence element good if it equals to the sum of some three elements in positions strictly smaller than i . Now nikki asks you a simple question how many good elements does the sequence contain?
//
//    Note : An element can be used more than once in the sum i.e lets say sequence is [1 3 5 9] (indexing from 0) consider the following points -
//
//            1) In sequence 1 is not good obviously.
//
//            2) 3 is good as 1 can be added three times to get 3
//
//            3) 5 is good as adding two times 1 and one time 3 will give 5
//
//            4) 9 is good as 1+3+5=9 and also adding element 3 three times will give 9 so any of these condition can be used to count 9 as good.
//
//    Input :
//
//    The first line of input contains the positive integer N , the length of the sequence A. The second line of input contains N space-separated integers representing the sequence A .
//
//    Output :
//
//    The first and only line of output must contain the number of good elements in the sequence.
//
//            Constraints :
//
//            1 <= N <= 5000
//
//            -10^5 <= Ai <= 10^5

//    is the output correct??
//    I think 2,3,5,7 and 10 can be formed by adding numbers less their index position.
//    So the number of such numbers is 5

//    U have to add three elements to get the number. I think 2 should not be in the answer.
